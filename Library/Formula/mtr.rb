    mtr requires superuser privileges. You can either run the program
    via `sudo`, or change its ownership to root and set the setuid bit:

      sudo chown root:wheel #{sbin}/mtr
      sudo chmod u+s #{sbin}/mtr

    In any case, you should be certain that you trust the software you
    are executing with elevated privileges.
